    <h3>Why are these albums my top 3?</h3>

    <div class="descriptive-box">
         <p>Each album brings a different vibe to the table and each of them can be correlated to a
        different feeling you may have. For example, 808s & Heartbreak is played when you're heartbroken. My Beautiful
        Dark Twisted Fantasy is played when you're feeling like you're really exited and Yeezus can be played when you just
        want loud music and strange sounds to play.
    </p>
    <p>
         These albums are my top three and I wish that I could put them in order from one to three, but there is no way that I could do that. This is because
        they rotate being my top album. Although I chose these albums, I enjoy the entirety of Kanye's discography. If you are courious of some
        of my runner ups, those would be "The Life of Pablo" and "Graduation"
